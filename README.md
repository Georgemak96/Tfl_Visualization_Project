# Tfl_Visualization_Project
This is a project that was implemented for evaluation purposes during the "Managing and Visualizing Data" module in the Department of Statistics, LSE. The project's aim is to understand transportation user behaviour in the UK so as to formulate policies to encourage the UK's Net-Zero goals. To that extent, several data sources were utilized, such as publicly available 'Transport for London' datasets, as well as web-scraped cycle and tube data.

## Understanding Transportation User Behavior in the UK to Encourage Net-Zero Goals

Understanding the user behavior of private and public means of transportation and the externalities (weather, congestion) that impact their usage is crucial for supporting the implementation of strategic decisions to mitigate emmitted from transportation modes. Believing in the previously mentioned, we aspire to answer the following question in this report: Can understanding transportation user behaviour in the UK help in formulating policies to encourage the UK's Net-Zero goals?

We conducted a thorough analysis on the usage of vehicles on the road (e.g., cars, buses, cycles) and the tube and rail stations in the UK. After detailed exploratory analyses of datasets on transportation modes, weather, tube congestion, and
emmissions, we found that cars and taxis yield the largest portion of emmissions across all regions in the UK, pedal cycles are used more on weekdays than weekends and the least in winter in London, and that congestion has no impact on the usage of tube and rail services given their critical role in England's tube/rail transport network, and possibly their accessibility. We found that the transport network is interconnected across all modes of transportation, with most stations of similar modes having similar transportation patterns.

Recommendations on nudging Londoners to use cycles on weekends and during the winter can aid in decreasing
emmissions. 
Enhancing service planning, resource distribution, and infrastructure development to take in an increasing passenger demand and end possible future congestion in tube stations will aid in maintaining tube/rail performance if not better it.
